    <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>My name is Mike Greene.</p> 
    <p>I grew up in Toms River, NJ.</p> 
    <p>If you know nothing about Toms River, here are some interesting facts about my hometown:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the 1990's, our national little league team qualified for the little league world series 3 times in 5 years, ultimately defeating the legendary 1998 Japanese team to win the world championship.</li>
      <li>Our three highschools during my generation have produced a number of professional athletes: Frankie Edgar (Fmr. UFC Champion), Todd Frazier (3B, NY Mets), Darian Barnes (FB, last team: N.O. Saints), the list goes on.</li>
      <li>Toms River is featured in the events of series and films like BoardWalk Empire, The Sopranos, and The Amnityville Horror. The setting of MTV's 'The Jersey Shore' is our actual boardwalk.</li>
      <li>We know EVERYBODY. If you ask someone from New Jersey if they know someone else from New Jersey, we can usualy play 5 degrees of separation to eventually find a common acquaintance. In Toms River, let's go ahead and shorten that to 3 degrees.</li>
      <li>In 2007, Toms River was voted the 14th safest place to live in America.</li>
      <li>In short, that place is pretty sick.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In 2003, I enlisted in the US Army as Military Police. I spent about 9 years in the service. In 2012, I left the military to go back to school in Redmond, Washington where I studied game design.</p> 
    <p>In my own time, I work on developing my voice acting career. Please feel free to visit my site and listen to my reels <a href="https://www.mkgmultimedia.com/mike-greene-voice-over">here</a>.</p> 
    <p></p>
    <p>My favorite sport is boxing, in the service I trained/fought at amateur cruiserweight several times over the years. I haven't tried to compete since 2011 other than some sparring here and there at gyms, though. My favorite famous pro-fighter is Vasiliy Lomachenko, he is a future hall of famer and has less than 10 pro fights, it's astounding his rate of improvement and level of skill. My favorite up and comer is probably Ryan Garcia off the top of my head. One of the fastest crosses I've ever seen if you give him a chance to get into his rhythm.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My favorite type of music is Metal. I love everything from that heavy southern grind like Pscyho Holiday(Pantera) to norweigan supergroups like Warriors(I) to weird gross-out bands like War is All We Know(GWAR).</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My favorite hobbies are playing videos games and reading manga/mahnwa.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Favorite video games right now: Kerbal Space Program and Dragon Ball FighterZ.</li>
      <li>Favorite Mangas right now: One Punch Man(Yusuke Murata version) and Rokudenashi Blues.</li>
      <li>Favorite Manhwas right now: Weak Hero and Hardcore Leveling Warrior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Skills</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I have training in several fields of law enforcement and security, the motto of the Military Police Corps being, "Assist, Protect, Defend." This includes: law enforcement patrol, investigation, and inter-personal communication; Route recon and security; Weapons handling, including sidearms, long rifle, SMG, carbine, and SAW qualifications (mostly 'expert' or 'sharpshooter' ratings); Checkpoint Control; Physical Security, including anti-terrorism evasive driving, principle protection formations, secure route reconnaisance, and crisis intervention tactis.</li>
      <li>I have a high level of driver's training. Currently I work as a licensing instructor/certified examiner. This time behind the wheel instructing others including my time spent on mission from the military has bestowed me with a high driving skill useful for all instruction, security, or safety type training purposes.</li>
      <li>I have worked in several retail environments, learning product details quickly and relaying them to customers to inform them better on their purchases is something thatk comes second nature.</li>
      <li>I work well with children and young adults. I have acted as a program director for a children's summer camp, managing staff, payroll, scheduling and individual needs of campers. In my current work, I usually work with teenagers between ages 14-19 who are practicing to earn their driver's licenses and as such need to be fast in response and calm in nature to allow them to relax while they practice.</li>
      <li>I learn new things fairly quickly as long as I have good examples provided to me, and will remember them far longer than I ever should even after leaving an organization.</li>
    </ul>
